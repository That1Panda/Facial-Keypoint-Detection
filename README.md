# Facial Keypoint Detection with Transfer Learning

Welcome to the **Facial Keypoint Detection** project! This repository demonstrates how to detect facial keypoints using transfer learning with a pretrained **VGG16** model. The entire workflow, from downloading and preparing the data to training the model and testing it on new images, is included in a single Jupyter Notebook for clarity and convenience.

This project is inspired by and guided by the book **"Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch"**.

## 📁 Project Structure
The repository includes:
- **`Facial-Keypoint-Detection.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete pipeline for the project.

---

## 📖 Features
1. **Data Downloading & Preparation**  
   - Includes loading and preprocessing a facial keypoint dataset.  
   - The keypoints are normalized to improve model performance.  
   - Images are resized to match the VGG16 input size.

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - **Transfer Learning**: A pretrained **VGG16** model is used as the backbone.  
   - **Custom Layers**: Additional fully connected layers are added to predict the coordinates of facial keypoints.  

3. **Training Process**  
   - Utilizes a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss for regression of keypoint coordinates.  
   - Uses **Adam optimizer** for faster convergence.

4. **Testing on New Images**  
   - The model is tested on unseen images to validate its performance.  
   - Visualizations show predicted keypoints overlaid on the images.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy opencv-python
   ```

2. **Download Dataset**  
   The dataset is automatically downloaded as part of the notebook execution.

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to execute the full pipeline.

4. **Test on New Images**  
   Upload your own images to see the model's predictions.
